## Lessons Learned

At the very beginning, I only had knowledge of the front-end part, the idea was to create a complete gigatron web application (site), which meant that I had to step into the unknown, which was the server and database. That unknown territory taught me a lot and I can say that I had a lot of fun on that backend side. The idea was to make the front-end part of the application more interesting and beautiful than it is currently, while adding some functionality that gigatron.rs does not currently have. The implementation of navigation on mobile devices, which is very accessible, was the main idea, as was the online submission of complaints and the extension of the warranty. The database was one of the more boring parts since I had to create it from scratch and that led to the other side of me starting to develop the environment behind the application itself where things on the site would be managed. So all in all I can say that in the last year I have had a lot of ups and downs in terms of app development but it has helped me progress a lot.
